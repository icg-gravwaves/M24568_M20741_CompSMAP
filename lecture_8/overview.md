# Lecture 8: Data manipulation (with pandas)

In this lecture, we will introduce you to the data analysis library for Python ``pandas``. ``pandas`` is used extensively analysing and manipulating data, designed to be open source, powerful, flexible and easy to use. It is used widely in a variety of academic and commercial settings.

OUTLINE:

 - DataFrames - dictionaries on steroids
 - Viewing data
 - Selection - Selecting particular elements of a Data Frame
 - More operations on DataFrame's rows/columns/entries
 - Grouping
 - Visualisation of DataFrames
 - Importing and Exporting files/spreadsheets.
 - Summary Exercises

Please note, as a notebook on data manipulation you will need to import the data files into your Colab environment (see video in week 4). Please do download the 3 datasets from Moodle. Each notebook will identify which datasets it will require.
