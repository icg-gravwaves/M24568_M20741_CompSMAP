For example, one dataset might have values like `[1, 3, 5]`, while another might have much larger values like `[100, 200, 300]`.\n","If we want to **compare** these datasets fairly, we need to put them on the **same scale**. One way to do this is to **transform each dataset** so that:\n","\n","* its **average (mean)** is 0, and\n","* its **spread (standard deviation)** is 1.\n","\n","This process is called **standardising** the data.\n","\n","Let’s see a small example:\n","Our dataset is `[1, 3, 5]`.\n","\n","* The mean (average) is 3.\n","* The standard deviation is about 1.633.\n","\n","To standardise this data:\n","\n","1. Subtract the mean from each value.\n","2.
