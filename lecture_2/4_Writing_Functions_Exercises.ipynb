    "Write a function that takes a single input value, $x$ and returns that number cubed $x^3$. The function should be called `cube`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you think you know how to do this, or how to do *parts* of this, please go ahead. If not, or if you need hints on parts of this, please read through the steps below.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Step 1: Add a  `def` line. All functions begin with a `def` line. This provides two things: The *name* of the function, the *input parameters* to the function. So write a line that looks something like `def cube(x):` The `def` says that this is a function, the `cube` is the name of the function, `x` is the *one* input parameter. Don't forget the `:`, which is used to indicate that the function will now start and the next line will be indented.\n",
    "* Step 2: Add the docstring. Add another line explaining what the function will do. This step is *optional* but helps to document your code. So something like `\"\"\"Cube a number\"\"\"`. If you need more space, write this over more than one line (that's why we use triple quotes here).\n",
    "* Step 3: Add the function body. This is the bulk of writing a function, and as we get further in the course the function bodies will get larger and more complex. In this case we just need to assign a new variable to store $x^3$. So add something like `y = x**3`. **Remember indentation here**. The body (and docstring) of a function should be indented. So this should actually be `    y = x**3`. 4 spaces (one level of indentation) and then the code.\n",
    "* Step 4: Add the return statement. Most (but not all) functions will have a `return` statement (functions will have an implicit `return None` if you don't write a `return`, or the function never reaches a `return` statement). In this case we want to `return` the value of $x^3$ that we have computed and stored in `y`. So we would do `    return y` (remembering indentation again). \n",
