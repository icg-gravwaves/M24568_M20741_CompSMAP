    "# How to write your own function\n",

    "We've now seen how to \"call\" a function, but we're going to need to be able to write our own functions to do new things. So lets learn how to write our own function in python. **Most of the coursework questions will be \"Write a function to do [SOMETHING], it's therefore crucial to know this bit**\n",

    "\n",
    " Just under the `def` statement, we can put a string which documents the function.\n",

    "Then the body of the function does all the calculations, using the values in the argument variables. At the end, we have a `return` statement, which determines what the function outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's see an example of this in code. This function takes one input value and returns that value squared."
