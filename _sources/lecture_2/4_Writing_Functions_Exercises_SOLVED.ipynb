The function should be called `cube`.\n","\n","If you think you know how to do this, or how to do *parts* of this, please go ahead. If not, or if you need hints on parts of this, please read through the steps below.\n","\n","* Step 1: Add a  `def` line. All functions begin with a `def` line. This provides two things: The *name* of the function, the *input parameters* to the function. So write a line that looks something like `def cube(x):` The `def` says that this is a function, the `cube` is the name of the function, `x` is the *one* input parameter. Don't forget the `:`, which is used to indicate that the function will now start and the next line will be indented.\n","* Step 2: Add the docstring. Add another line explaining what the function will do. This step is *optional* but helps to document your code. So something like `\"\"\"Cube a number\"\"\"`. If you need more space, write this over more than one line (that's why we use triple quotes here).\n","* Step 3: Add the function body. This is the bulk of writing a function, and as we get further in the course the function bodies will get larger and more complex. In this case we just need to assign a new variable to store $x^3$. So add something like `y = x**3`. **Remember indentation here**. The body (and docstring) of a function should be indented. So this should actually be `    y = x**3`. 4 spaces (one level of indentation) and then the code.\n","* Step 4: Add the return statement. Most (but not all) functions will have a `return` statement (functions will have an implicit `return None` if you don't write a `return`, or the function never reaches a `return` statement). In this case we want to `return` the value of $x^3$ that we have computed and stored in `y`. So we would do `    return y` (remembering indentation again).\n","\n","Please ask us if you are not clear on any of this!"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":7,"id":"50510d2e","metadata":{"id":"50510d2e","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1696494322577,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":2,"user":{"displayName":"Ian Harry","userId":"09765021565160415280"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["def cube(x):\n","    \"\"\"Return the cube of x\"\"\"\n","    y = x**3\n","    return y"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["cube(4)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"V_75cE0Z8Ef3","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1696494323869,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":325,"user":{"displayName":"Ian Harry","userId":"09765021565160415280"}},"outputId":"8f6c351e-2735-45ed-afb6-8a9eac3f7387"},"id":"V_75cE0Z8Ef3","execution_count":8,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["64"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":8}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"7c6e6aa1","metadata":{"id":"7c6e6aa1"},"source":["### Testing your function.\n","\n","Run the cell below to test your function.
