    "1. Download the datafile ```sunspot.month.csv``` from Moodle and upload it to the same directory in which this notebook is running.\n",
    "1. The data is read in using the supplied functions below.\n",
    "2. Plot the number of sunspots as a function of time. Make sure the plot is properly labelled. This should show the number of sunspots varying over time following a sinusoidal behaviour.\n",
    "1. Add Poisson counting error bars to the y-values. (Poisson counting error bars are simply +/-sqrt N).\n",
    "3. Limit the extent of your axes to 30 years for an interval of your choice.\n",
    "5. Save this plot.\n",
    "1. Create a histogram of the number of sunspots\n",
    "1. Label etc. the plot as needed\n",
    "1. Save this plot as well."
