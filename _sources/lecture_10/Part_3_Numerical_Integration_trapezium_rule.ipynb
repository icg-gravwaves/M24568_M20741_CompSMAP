    "The rectangle rule is a \"0th order\" solution for numerical integration. Let's now consider a \"1st order\" solution. The difference is that with rectangles we are assuming that the value of the function is constant over the rectangle and jumps to a new value when we get to next one. What if instead the function varied (in a straight line) between each point. To do that we use trapeziums instead of rectangles, and we need to evaluate the value of the function at the *edge* of each trapezium not in the middle.\n",
