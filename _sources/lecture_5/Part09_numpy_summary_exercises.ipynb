Standardisation is the process of considering different data sets on the same scale to make some comparisons between different type of datasets.\n","\n","This means that we need to transform our dataset so that it has zero mean and its standard deviation is 1. So that every dataset that we process will follow this rule.\n","\n","To demonstrate this on a simple example our data set is\n","$[1, 3, 5]$ then its mean is $3$ and standard deviation is approximately $1.633$ (rounding with precision to 3 d.p.).\n","\n","To standardise this data set we would subtract the mean from each of the element and then divide each element by the standard deviation.\n","\n","Hence we transform $[1, 3, 5]$ into $\\left[\\frac{1-3}{1.633}, \\frac{3-3}{1.633}, \\frac{5-3}{1.633}  \\right] = \\left[ -1.225, 0, 1.225\\right]$. The transformed data will have mean zero, and standard deviation one.\n","\n","**Your task**\n","\n","Write a function that takes as an input a 2D numpy array.\n","\n","Then standarlise each row of the input array (we treat each row as a new dataset).\n","\n","Your function should return a new 2D numpy array that contains standarlised row.
