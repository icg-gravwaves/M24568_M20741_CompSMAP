    "* Find values of $x$ that satisfy $x^2 - 1 = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This case can be solved analytically, it will be true if $x^2 = 1$, and there are two cases where $x^2 = 1$, either $x=1$ or $x=-1$. $x=-1$, or $x=1$ would then be the two *roots* (or solutions) of this equation."

We then iterate until we find a value of x that is suitably close to 0. This is our solution."
