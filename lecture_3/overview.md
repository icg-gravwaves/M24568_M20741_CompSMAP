# Lecture 3: Loops and lists 

In Lecture 3 we dig deeper in learning the fundamentals of Python programming
and programming constructs more generally.
In particular we will teach you

* How to write and use for loops and while loops.
* When to use the list object to solve problems. 
* How to apply loops and lists alongside functions,conditionals and logic to solve more involved problems.

The weekly tasks are split up into a series of *sequential* notebooks. Any of these can be opened below by clicking on them. Some of these are interactive notebooks, where you will run and/or write code in the cells. To open any of the notebooks interactively, first click on the section, then click on the rocket and select "Colab".
