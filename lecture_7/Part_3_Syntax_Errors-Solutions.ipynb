    "In this, and subsequent, noteboooks in this class we'll walk through a number of different problems. Each of these fail in some way. For many of the early problems, the issue can be solved by inspecting the code. However, for later ones you may need to use PDB to really understand what the code is doing and diagnose the problems. Some of the later problem sets are quite challenging, so just get through as much of this as you can. **There are no \"summary exercises\" this week, just work through as much as you can. Try to get at least as far as exercise 5**. Good luck!"
