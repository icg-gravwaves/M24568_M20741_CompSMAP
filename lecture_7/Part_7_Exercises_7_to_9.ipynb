For 24, that is (2,2,2,3) because `2*2*2*3=24` and that's how to express 24 in terms of only prime numbers. Then take the sum of these factors `2+2+2+3 = 9`. Then repeat the process until you get a prime number *or* until you get to a point where the number isn't changing. So `9=3*3` -> `3+3 = 6` -> `6=3*2` -> `3+2=5` -> `5=5`. And as 5 is a prime number we stop and return 5.\n",
